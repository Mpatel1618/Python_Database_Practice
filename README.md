This file contains practice with accessing different files and getting information off of them.

This program shows that I can access a python database and get specific information off of it. I can get access to dictionaries, sets, and lists off of a different files and organize them in a meaningful way. It also displays my skill in editing these different dictionaries, sets, and lists.
